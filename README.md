#Let's Drill!

Just to test our knowledge of Ruby, let's solve a few puzzles.

A few of my assumptions:
- You've been able to get Ruby up and running on your computer
- You know how to run a Ruby script from the command line

If any of the above is untrue, please let me know.

Enjoy!


#Exercises

##Calculate a grade
Create a method `get_letter_grade` that accepts a classroom grade and returns the letter grade as a String. It should return only 'A', 'B', 'C','D', or 'F'.

```
get_letter_grade(90) => returns "A"

get_letter_grade(74) => returns "C"
```

##Find the shortest string in an array
Create a function `shortest_string` that accepts an array of strings and returns the shortest.

```
shortest_string(['apple', 'car', 'yo']) => returns "yo"

shortest_string(['fargo', 'columbus', 'indianapolis']) => returns "fargo"
```
